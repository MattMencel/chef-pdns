  this cookbook more wrapper pattern friendly. Remember kids, don't put node
  attributes in your attributes folder, everyone will have a bad time. :(

  cookbook. Nothing intense, but should help get things looking spiffy :+1:

  Chef Supermarket.

  resolver and an authoritative on the same machine anymore.
